# nerdctl: Docker-compatible CLI for containerd

`nerdctl` is a Docker-compatible CLI for [contai**nerd**](https://containerd.io).

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/378377.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/378377)

## Examples

To run a container with the default CNI network (10.4.0.0/16):
```console
# nerdctl run -it --rm alpine
```

To build an image using BuildKit:
```console
# nerdctl build -t foo .
# nerdctl run -it --rm foo
```

To list Docker containers:
```console
# nerdctl --namespace moby ps -a
```

To list Kubernetes containers:
```console
# nerdctl --namespace k8s.io ps -a
```

## Install
Binaries are available for amd64, arm64, and arm-v7: https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/nerdctl/releases

In addition to containerd, the following components should be installed (optional):
- [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins): for internet connectivity.
- [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit): for using `nerdctl build`. BuildKit daemon (`buildkitd`) needs to be running.

## Motivation

The goal of `nerdctl` is to facilitate experimenting the cutting-edge features of containerd that are not present in Docker.

Such features includes, but not limited to, [lazy-pulling](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter) and [encryption of images](https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt).

Also, `nerdctl` might be potentially useful for debugging Kubernetes clusters, but it is not the primary goal.

## Similar tools

- `ctr`: incompatible with Docker, and not friendly to users
- [`crictl`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools): incompatible with Docker, not friendly to users, and does not support non-CRI features
- [k3c](https://github.com/rancher/k3c): needs an extra daemon, and does not support non-CRI features
- [PouchContainer](https://github.com/alibaba/pouch): needs an extra daemon

## Implementation status of Docker-compatible commands and flags

- `nerdctl build`
  - `-t, --tag`
  - `--target`
  - `--build-arg`
  - `--no-cache`
  - `--progress`
  - `--secret`
  - `--ssh`

  - `-q, --quiet`: Only display container IDs

- `nerdctl pull`

- `nerdctl rm`
  - `-f`

  - `--restart=(no|always)`
  - `--rm`
  - `--network=(bridge|host|none)`
  - `-p, --publish` (WIP: currently TCP only)

  - `--security-opt apparmor`
  - `--security-opt no-new-privileges`
  - `--privileged`
  - `-v, --volume`

- `nerdctl version`

Lots of commands and flags are currently missing. Pull requests are highly welcome.

## Features present in `nerdctl` but not present in Docker
- Namespacing as in `kubectl --namespace=<NS>`: `nerdctl --namespace=<NS> ps`
- [Lazy-pulling using Stargz Snapshotter](./docs/stargz.md): `nerdctl --snapshotter=stargz run`

## Compiling nerdctl from source

Run `make && sudo make install`.

Using `go get github.com/AkihiroSuda/nerdctl` is possible, but unrecommended because it does not fill version strings printed in `nerdctl version`
